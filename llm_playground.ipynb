    "# Project 1: Build an LLM Playground\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first project! In this project, you'll build a simple large language model (LLM) playground, an interactive environment where you can experiment with LLMs and understand how they work under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to understand the foundations and mechanics behind LLMs rather than relying on higher-level abstractions or frameworks. You'll see what happens under the hood, how an LLM receives text, processes it, and generates a response. In later projects, you'll use frameworks like `Ollama` and `LangChain` that simplify many of these steps. But before that, this project will help you build a solid mental model of how LLMs actually work.\n",

Given some input, it predicts what words come next. It has no concept of questions, instructions, or conversation. If you type `\"What is 2+2?\"`, GPT-2 will continue the text as if it were part of a web page or article. It does not understand you are asking a question.\n",

Client applications send requests and receive responses over HTTP — the model itself stays loaded in memory (and on the GPU) between requests.\n",
